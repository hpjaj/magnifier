        Description of change\r\nDiscussion that drove this change can be found in
        this issue:  \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/12447\r\n\r\nAll
        of our deployed envs (dev, staging, and production) have their `Rails.env`
        set to ''production''.  We need a global way to determine which env(staging,
        dev, or prod) we''re in, to target behavior specifically to any of those envs.  \r\n\r\nOne
        use case is the iHub integration.  Their API uses a slightly different endpoint,
        depending on us calling their staging environment, vs. their production environment.\r\n\r\nHere
        is an excerpt from a discussion in [a devops PR](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/pull/3142#discussion_r210639256):\r\n\r\n>
        I''m surprised something like this doesn''t already exist as some kind of
        over-arching variable for everyone to use. Something that would return an
        enum of `DEV|STAGING|PRODUCTION` or something or perhaps named helpers like
        Vets.env.dev? & Vets.env.staging?, & Vets.env.production?.\r\n\r\nAnd another
        excerpt from [another devops PR](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/pull/3080#issuecomment-408097790)\r\n\r\n>
        but do we want to just set like a global deployment_env variable? It might
        get confusing with RAILS_ENV (which is always prod for the environments we
        run in AWS), but I don''t know if it''d be worthwhile other places?\r\n\r\n##

        Testing done\r\n<!-- Please describe testing done to verify the changes. -->\r\nLocal

        (Definition of Done)\r\n\r\n#### Unique to this PR\r\n- [x] Add three settings
        to `settings.yml`\r\n- [x] Refactor the current `Settings.ihub.in_production`
        usage to use new settings\r\n- [x] Update these settings in our DevOps repo
        \r\n\r\n#### Applies to all PRs\r\n\r\n- [x] Appropriate logging\r\n- [x]
        Swagger docs have been updated, if applicable\r\n- [x] Provide link to originating
        GitHub issue, or connected to it via ZenHub\r\n- [x] Does not contain any
        sensitive information (i.e. PII/credentials/internal URLs/etc., in logging,
        hardcoded, or in specs)\r\n- [x] Provide which alerts would indicate a problem
        with this functionality (if applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-13T16:44:44Z","updated_at":"2018-12-13T21:54:19Z","closed_at":"2018-12-13T21:53:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3d44c9a9f031a81b4fd63ca9536de58d4bfe8540","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kreek","id":283834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/283834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreek","html_url":"https://github.com/kreek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"wyattwalter","id":558322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODMyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/558322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/wyattwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattwalter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"omgitsbillryan","id":3077884,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzc4ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3077884?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/omgitsbillryan","html_url":"https://github.com/omgitsbillryan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omgitsbillryan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omgitsbillryan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omgitsbillryan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omgitsbillryan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omgitsbillryan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omgitsbillryan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omgitsbillryan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omgitsbillryan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omgitsbillryan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"kfrz","id":11085141,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDg1MTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11085141?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfrz","html_url":"https://github.com/kfrz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfrz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfrz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfrz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfrz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfrz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfrz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfrz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfrz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfrz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pulls/2664/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pulls/2664/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/issues/2664/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/statuses/7409c2adc2407e43e906b2f0d061212487f2bdc3","head":{"label":"department-of-veterans-affairs:12447-global-env-setting","ref":"12447-global-env-setting","sha":"7409c2adc2407e43e906b2f0d061212487f2bdc3","user":{"login":"department-of-veterans-affairs","id":5421563,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU0MjE1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5421563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/department-of-veterans-affairs","html_url":"https://github.com/department-of-veter
